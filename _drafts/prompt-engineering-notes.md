Prompt engineering describes the process of giving instructions to large language models (LLMs) for a specific purpose. These instructions, or prompts, are written in natural language, which makes building chat-based applications accessible to people without deep learning expertise. Using prompt engineering with LLMs enables developers to harness the power of LLMs without having to train or fine-tune the underlying model itself. This paradigm facilitates rapid prototyping, iteration, and deployment. Like any subfield, there are techniques and considerations which lend themselves to optimal performance. [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) offers a short course called [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/chatgpt-prompt-eng/) which contains best practices for prompt engineering across a number of common use cases. This post contains my notes from the course.
